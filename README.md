A small interactive game prototype built with Python and Pygame, designed to explore principles of user interaction, feedback, and game flow.

## âœ¨ Design Goals
- Intuitive Controls: Simple left/right arrow key movement for immediate player engagement.  
- Clear Feedback: Visual score and life counters at the top of the screen provide instant status updates.  
- Challenge & Flow: Difficulty balanced through bouncing mechanics and falling obstacles to keep players engaged without being overwhelming.  
- Win/Lose Conditions: End states ("You Win!" or "Game Over!") deliver closure and emotional payoff.

## ðŸŽ® User Experience
- Onboarding: No tutorial needed â€” the rules are learned through direct interaction.  
- Visual Cues:  
  - Bright ball and paddle graphics highlight core mechanics.  
  - Pink obstacles stand out against the soft blue background, signaling danger.  
- Feedback Loop: Scoring points gives positive reinforcement, while losing lives signals mistakes.
